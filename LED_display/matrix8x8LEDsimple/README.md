I wrote verilog for simple 8x8 dot matrix LED by referenced [fpga4fun.com - Opto 3 - 7-segments LED displays](https://www.fpga4fun.com/Opto3.html).

I use PIN_1 to PIN_8 and GND, so this code output only line blink, no dot blink.

If you want to blink by dot to dot, you have to use more 8 pins for row signal.
